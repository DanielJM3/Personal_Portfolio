        <p>Hi, my name is Daniel Mendoza and I am a full stack web developer eager to grow my career in the industry. My path into web development was not the traditional one however I do feel it is a path that a lot of people would be able to relate to. If you took a look at my resume already you would notice that I have a batchelors degree in game development and not web development.</p>
        <p>I was one of those students that didn't end up enjoying what they went to school for but had spent to much time and money on it that they felt it was necessary to follow through. Ironically, when I graduated the world get hit by a global pandemic making finding a job near impossible in an indusry that was already hard to get a foot in the door. After fielding rejection letters for 6 months I took it as a sign to spend the rest of the lockdowns pursuing a career in something I enjoyed more.</p>
        <p>I had taken web development courses as electives in university as well as had a good programming foundation from working on videogames. I decided to take this foundation and try to make my way into the web development indusry instead of game.</p>
        <p>I moved to Indiana to help take care of my elderly grandmother before I had other obligations preventing me from doing so.</p>
